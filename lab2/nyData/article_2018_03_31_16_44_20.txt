In “The Fire Next Time,” James Baldwin wrote that “to accept one’s past — one’s history — is not the same thing as drowning in it.” He knew that the superstitious fear of being swallowed up, the dread of giving up a fantasy of innocence, is precisely what keeps so many white Americans from confronting the uglier aspects of the nation’s legacy.Travis Wilkerson, a documentary filmmaker whose roots are in small-town Alabama, attempts just such a reckoning in “Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?” The movie, a scorching and rigorous essay on memory and accountability, is neither a profession of guilt nor a performance of virtue. Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.
