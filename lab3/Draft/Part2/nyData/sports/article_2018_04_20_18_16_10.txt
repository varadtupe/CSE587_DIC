INDIANAPOLIS —  USA Gymnastics has reached a confidential settlement in a Georgia lawsuit that spurred a newspaper investigation into the organization's practices for reporting child abuse.A former gymnast filed the lawsuit against USA Gymnastics in 2013, alleging that the organization that trains Olympians received at least four warnings about coach William McCabe, who videotaped her in various states of undress.The lawsuit revealed that USA Gymnastics wouldn't forward child sex abuse allegations to authorities unless they were in writing and signed by a victim or a victim's parent.A judge in Effingham County, Georgia, dismissed the lawsuit on April 12, according to court records. USA Gymnastics admits no wrongdoing or liability in the settlement, said W. Brian Cornwell of Cornwell & Stevens LLP, the gymnast's lawyer.Both parties have declined to comment on the settlement."We want to make it clear that the settlement does not prevent the former gymnast from speaking publicly about her experiences," USA Gymnastics said in a statement Thursday.McCabe pleaded guilty in Georgia in 2006 to federal charges of sexual exploitation of children and making false statements. He's serving a 30-year prison sentence.The suit sparked The Indianapolis Star's investigation of USA Gymnastics, which exposed abuse by Larry Nassar, a former Michigan State University sports doctor, and spurred the resignations of the organization's president and board.Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty to molesting patients and possessing child pornography. He was sentenced this year to prison terms that will keep him locked up for life after roughly 200 women gave statements against him in two courtrooms over 10 days.USA Gymnastics faces additional lawsuits from women who say Nassar sexually abused them. The suits allege the organization was negligent, fraudulent and intentionally inflicted emotional distress by failing to warn or protect athletes from Nassar's abuse. The organization has denied the allegations and wants the lawsuits dismissed.___Information from: The Indianapolis Star, http://www.indystar.com
