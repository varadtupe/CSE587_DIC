No matter what family you’re a part of, you’re going to see your family up there on the stage.”The Second Stage revival of “Torch Song,” directed by Moisés Kaufman, opened in October at the Tony Kiser Theater with Michael Urie and Mercedes Ruehl in the starring roles as Arnold and his overbearing mother. In his Times review, Ben Brantley said that Mr. Urie and Ms. Ruehl were “two ideally matched performers, at the top of their games,” and he named the show a Critic’s Pick.In a statement, Mr. Fierstein said, “Seeing this new production of ‘Torch Song’ was thrilling. The audiences’ laughter seemed heartier, their tears more profound, and I could not have been happier.”The original Broadway production of the three-part, four-hour “Torch Song” opened in 1982 at the Little Theater, now called the Helen Hayes, with Mr. Fierstein playing Arnold. The following year he won two Tony Awards, for best play and best actor in a play.The Helen Hayes is set to reopen on March 1 after a renovation.Tickets for “Torch Song” will go on sale to the public on March 9 at 10 a.m.
