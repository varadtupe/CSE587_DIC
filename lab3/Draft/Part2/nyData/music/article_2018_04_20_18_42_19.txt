Lucinda Williams — a performer and prolific songwriter whose career stretches back more than three decades — is writing a memoir to be published by Henry Holt and Company in 2020.It will explore the genesis of her deeply personal catalog, filled with a blend of rock, folk, country, blues and gospel stemming from her southern roots.“I have a lot to say and a big story to tell,” Ms. Williams said in a news release. “I want everyone to know what’s behind the songs and to know more about me than what people previously thought they knew. It’s time to tell my truth.”Ms. Williams first became known to a national audience with her self-titled album in 1988. She was 35. Since then, she has amassed three Grammys, including one in 1998, for best contemporary folk album — “Car Wheels on a Gravel Road” — considered to be among her best work. She has been nominated for 15 Grammys in total. In 2001, Time magazine named her America’s Best Songwriter. The book will detail Ms. Williams’s upbringing — including her childhood, which was spread out across the South. She was born in Lake Charles, La., and spent some of her younger days busking in New Orleans. It will also chronicle her experience navigating an unfriendly record industry.The terms of the deal for the yet-to-be-titled book were not disclosed.
