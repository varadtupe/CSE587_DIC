Welcome to Times Insider Events — live programming for Times Insiders and their guests. Times Insider offers behind-the-scenes insights into news, features and opinion at The New York Times.It has been 84 years since the 1933 repeal of Prohibition. What better way to celebrate than to join us for an educational — and warming — conversation as we explore the historical role of American women in the distilling and brewing industries?From the temperance and Prohibition era, which helped female reformers find their voices, through the ratification of the 21st Amendment, and on to the contemporary golden age of brown spirits, we’ll trace the trajectory of women in whiskey and sisters in suds over the past eight decades.Jennifer Steinhauer, editor of live journalism in our Washington bureau, will moderate a discussion with Rachel Gardner, co-founder and head distiller of Republic Restoratives, the first woman-owned distillery in the capital; Julie Verratti, the co-founder of Denizens Brewing Company and a champion of local tax reform for small-business brewers; and Garrett Peck, a historian and the author of “Prohibition in Washington, D.C.”Mark the anniversary with quality conversation and whiskey and beer tasting, hosted by The New York Times.You may purchase tickets here.
