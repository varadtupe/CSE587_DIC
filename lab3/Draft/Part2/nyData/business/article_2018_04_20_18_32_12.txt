LONDON —  A British prosecutor says five financial traders charged with rigging a key interest rate were in essence betting on a fixed horse race as their trial gets underway at Southwark Crown Court in London.The men are accused of manipulating the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, a benchmark used to set interest rates on many financial products, including mortgages and credit cards. The charges were filed as part of a wider investigation into interest rate manipulation.Former Deutsche Bank employee Achim Kraemer, 53, and former Barclays Bank traders Philippe Moryoussef, 49; Sisse Bohart, 41; Colin Bermingham, 61; and Carlo Palombo, 39, all deny the charges.Prosecutor James Waddington says Wednesday "the only way in which these traders could make money was making sure that other people lost money."
